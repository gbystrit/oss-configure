Compiling GCC on all platforms:

- Compile the following prerequisite packages:
    texinfo-2.14
    make-3.81
    gawk-3.1.6
    flex-2.5.35
    bison-2.3

- Compile binutils-2.19. See NOTE: for the nex item.

- Compile gcc-3.4.6 with whatever compiler available. 
  NOTE: May be challenging with some native compilers. At the time of this 
        writing, gcc-3.4.3 was available for all platforms in use. It was 
        located in here (may still be in archives):
        ~gbystrit/local/<platform-id>/gcc-3.4.3

- Make corresponding links in platorm's bin folder for gcc-3.4 and g++-3.4

- Compile gmp-4.2.4 and mfpr-2.3.2
  Issue "make check" after compile.

- Compile gcc-4.3.2 with gcc-3.4.

- Make corresponding links in platorm's bin folder for gcc-4.3 and g++-4.3

- Make links for gcc-4.3/lib/*.so.* in platform's lib folder.

General notes:
==============

All needed packages were taken as of the latest version at the time of this
writing, with some exceptions where indicated bellow.

For every package there's a backup SVN repository in svn-source-depot to track
possible local changes to the source to make things compile.
  
Encountered issues:
===================

Sometimes configure for a facility started complaining about autoconf not
being available. The latter is not required for distribution archive,
apparenlty some file/folder timestamp mess-up causes its use. To resolve, 
simply delete the facility folder and do "svn update".

Had to setup CONFIG_SHELL to ksh as on some platforms standard sh caused
configure problems (known issue). This works for almost all packages except
for bison -- it gives syntax error on Solaris when used with anything other
than sh (tried ksh, bash). 

UPDATE: In some cases it may hurt builds on some platforms. As an example, see
notes regarding flex build on sun-10-x86 bellow.

Some builds modify source files or leave some files behind. Those need to be
cleaned up with "svn revert".

sun-9-sparc
-----------

This is a base platform to build all dependency tools. sun-8-sparc and
sun-10-sparc will link whatever possible from this platform.

- Compiling texinfo-2.14 had an issue with unavailable help2man. Trying to
  compile help2man required downloading some perl modules from CPAN. To avoid
  this (it is only for man pages, after all), simply copied /bin/true to
  help2man in a directory on PATH and build succeeded.

- Bison was needed for compiling binutils-2.19. Tried first bison-2.4, then
  had to switch back to bison-2.3 because of sun-8-sparc issues (see bellow).

- Bison required GNU m4 package, had to build m4-1.4.12.

- Bison's configure failed with the platform's nawk, had to build gawk-3.1.6.

- GCC 3.4.6 required flex, had to build flex-2.5.35.

sun-8-sparc
-----------

This platform presented need for older bison package (2.3 instead of latest
2.4), as with the latest compiling gcc-3.4.6 produced errors when generating
c-parse.c.

- texinfo-2.14 linked from sun-9-sparc
- bison-2.3 linked from sun-9-sparc
- m4-1.4 linked from sun-9-sparc
- gawk-3.1 linked from sun-9-sparc

sun-10-sparc
------------

- texinfo-2.14 linked from sun-9-sparc
- bison-2.3 linked from sun-9-sparc
- m4-1.4 linked from sun-9-sparc
- gawk-3.1 linked from sun-9-sparc

sun-10-x86
----------

- binutils-2.19 (and later gcc-3.4.6 too)

  After building bison-2.4 and flex-2.5.35, had issues with generated code in
  files binutils/arlex.c and ld/ldlex.c -- not defined identifiers flex_int32_t,
  flex_int16_t, etc. To resolve, wait till compilation fails and then edit a
  corresponding file by replacing "flex_int" with just "int" and adding the
  following line to the beginning of the file:
  #include <inttypes.h>

  UPDATE: Above is not necessary. The real problem was flex-2.5.35 build --
  removing CONFIG_SHELL=ksh from configure/flex-2.5.35.sh fixed everything.
