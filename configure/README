Compiling GCC on all platforms:

- Compile texinfo-2.14 if not available. Needed for binutils build.

- Compile binutils-2.19. See NOTE: for the nex item.

- Compile gcc-3.4.6 with whatever compiler available. 
  NOTE: May be challenging with some native compilers. At the time of this 
        writing, gcc-3.4.3 was available for all platforms in use. It was 
        located in here (may still be in archives):
        ~gbystrit/local/<platform-id>/gcc-3.4.3

- Make corresponding links in platorm's bin folder for gcc-3.4 and g++-3.4

- Compile gmp-4.2.4 and mfpr-2.3.2

- Compile gcc-4.3.2 with gcc-3.4.
  
Encountered issues:

Sometimes configure for a facility started complaining about autoconf not
being available. The letter is not required for distribution archive,
apparenlty some file/folder timestamp mess-up causes its use. To resolve, 
simply delete the facility folder and do "svn update".

===========

Compiling texinfo-2.14 had an issue with unavailable help2man. Trying to
compile help2man required downloading some perl modules from CPAN. To avoid
this (it is only for man pages, after all), simply copied /bin/true to
help2man in a directory on PATH and build succeeded.

===========

- texinfo-2.14 linked from sun-9-sparc
- needs bison-2.4 as yacc is broken
- needs m4-1.4.12 to compile bison
